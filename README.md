# Snake-Game

Built a snake game using core java, java SWING, java awt
The play space is 300 x 300, When we start our game a snake of size 3 units is there initially
we use up, down, left, and right key's on the keyboard to move our snake, and the Apple apperas on the screen randomly.

If the snake touches itself or touches the boundary of the frame the game is over.
